x = 3 > 2 #expression: boolean expression because it displays a boolean (output: true)
x2 = 3 >= 2 #2 is less than or equal to 3
x3 = 3 <= 2 #3 is less than or equal to 3
x4 = 3 == 2 #== is used when example asking if one value is equal to the other, so the normal = is used to 
x5 = 3 != 2 #!= basically means here that 3 isn't equal to 2 so the output would be a true boolean statement
print("is 3 greater than 2? " + x)
print(x2)
print(x3)
print(x4)
print(x5)
